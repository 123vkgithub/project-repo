                        Step1:Prep the fish.
                        After getting the perfect fish fillets,<br>
                         you may like to wash them thoroughly and pat dry with a kitchen towel to get a crispy fried fish.<br><br>
                        
                        Step2:Combine the Marination Ingredients.
                        Once you have the ingredients ready simply combine them to make a paste with a little water.
                         Then apply this spicy masala paste to the fish slices and 
                         allow it to marinate for 15 to 20 minutes if you have the time. 
                         But if you are in a hurry you could just skip the marination time.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        Step3:Start Frying the Fish.
                        Heat the pan well and then add oil of your choice such as canola, 
                        sunflower, rice bran, etc. If using olive oil,
                         please take care to use the one that is meant for frying.
                          Allow the oil to heat for a few seconds before you add the fish fillets.<br><br>
                        
                        Step4:Fry the Fish on Both Sides.
                        Fry at least 3 to 4 minutes on each side.
                         Do not forcibly try to flip over the fish while frying let it release on its own. 
                         If you find the fish sticking to the pan it means that it needs a few more seconds to get done. 
                        Now flip over and let the fish fry for another 3 to 4 minutes or till done.
