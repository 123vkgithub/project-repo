    <b><u>How to make Gujarati dhokla</u>:-</b>

    In a mixing bowl take the besan. Add the sugar, oil, ginger-chilli paste, lemon juice, turmeric powder, salt and mix well.<br/>
    Add in the water slowly to form a pouring batter, without lumps.<br/>
    Keep this batter aside for 10 minutes.<br/>
    Grease the vessel in you want to steam it in with oil. (you canuse the vessel provided with the pressure cooker).<br/>
    Steam in a pressure cooker without whistle.<br/>
    Keep the cooker on flame with water in its bottom for steaming ready.<br/>
    Add the eno fruit salt in the batter and mix well. It will become frothy.<br/>
    Now from here you need to act fast. Pour the batter in the greased vessel/plate and keep it in the pressure cooker and close the lid without the whistle.<br/>
    Steam it for 10-15 minutes maximum without putting on the whistle on a medium flame.<br/>
    When done off the flame and remove the vessel out and leave to cool for 5 minutes.<br/>
    Invert it on a plate and cut into squares.<br/>
    Make the tempering. Heat oil. When the oil is hot enough add the mustard seeds and wait till they splutter.<br/>
    Off the flame. Add the Asafetida and curry leaves and keep aside to cool.<br/>
    Put the cooled tempering on the ready dhokla's.<br/>
    Garnish them with freshly scrapped coconut, chopped coriander and sprinkle red chilli powder and serve.<br/>
