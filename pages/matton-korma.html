                        Wash and drain the mutton pieces under cold running water.
                        Now add mutton pieces to a deep pan with 1/2 to 1 cup of water and a little salt.
                        Bring to a boil and reduce the flame. 
                        Now, blend the soaked poppy seeds to a paste.<br>
                        Step 2 Dry roast the spices
                        Simmer until the meat is 60% cooked and once it is done, turn off the flame. 
                        Take a pan and dry roast all the ingredients for a few minutes. 
                        Transfer the roasted masalas to a mixer grinder and grind to a fine paste. 
                        Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium flame.
                        Add the ground masala paste and stir-fry with a little water. 
                        Add the cooked mutton pieces in the pan and stir-fry until well coated. 
                        Add salt and mix well. 
                        Now add the curd and water along with poppy seeds paste and stir well.<br>
                        Step 3 Slow cook the mutton and serve hot!
                        Reduce flame and cover the pan with a lid. 
                        If you want to make it spicier,
                        add some black pepper powder this will accentuate the taste and will add a nice dark tint to the dish.
                         Allow the dish to simmer for 30 to 45 minutes or until the meat is tender. 
                        Turn off the heat and transfer the mutton recipe to a serving dish.
